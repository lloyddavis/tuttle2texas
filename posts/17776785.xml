<p>This clip is from my last breakfast with Brian in New Orleans, just before Taylor drove me over to Austin.  This was just after I&#39;d been <a href="http://tuttle2texas.posterous.com/lloyd-plays-in-nola">playing and singing on the front step of Laura&#39;s house</a> and we&#39;d done some final filming with Heather on the steps too, just summing up what we thought.  It was an important milestone in the trip and it was a very good breakfast - the <a href="http://www.nolacakes.com/">Cake Cafe on Chartres St</a><p /> We talk, as Englishmen so often do over breakfast, about the unexpected emotions that our encounters were bringing up.  And we recognised for the first time here, I think, the pivotal importance of our visit to Riderwood.<p /> I&#39;ve since been thinking about the roles that we each played throughout the trip.  I guess here we&#39;re both partly being analysts and recorders and Brian throws in a bit of good parenting at the end.<p />It&#39;s going to continue to be slow going I think with processing the video.  The bulk of what I have left needs to be stitched together as it was shot during the Austin to LA train ride. <p /> </p>]]></content:encoded>
