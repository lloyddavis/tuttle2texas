<p />
<div>I love this bit of any project - I thrive on the mix of certainty and uncertainty. &nbsp;You're certain that you're really truly going to launch/ship/do that thing but still uncertain over how everything will get done and just how it will all work out. &nbsp;I always like to call it Week Zero.</div>
<p />
<div>As I've taken my project life more and more into the realm of social art, it's just shifted a lot more into the uncertain. &nbsp;And this project is no different. &nbsp;With Tuttle, in the beginning, there was a time when I had to just say "OK, I'm going to show up here every week. &nbsp;I don't know how it's going to work. I don't know how I'm going to make any money, but I'm going to commit to a couple of hours every Friday, making sure that it happens and that people know it's here." &nbsp;I had no idea how it would turn out from there, and if I did have any ideas, what actually happened went far beyond my limited imagination.</div>
<p />
<div>So we're committed. &nbsp;We have the things in place to get started. &nbsp;We are all flying to North America, Brian's going to get there a bit earlier. &nbsp;On March 2nd (as I'm getting used to calling it - instead of "The Second of March"),&nbsp;Heather, Michelle and I are coming in from London and we're proud to announce that Dana is coming down from St John's to join us for the Boston and NYC. &nbsp;And we have <a href="http://tuttle2texas.posterous.com/were-doing-tuttle-boston-on-march-3rd">a great place to hang out in Boston</a>. &nbsp;And there are lots of other bits in place - the flow chart above shows me roughly what we know and don't know. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>There's lots of uncertainty about where Brian and I will be staying because we're middle-aged, stubborn, British men who would probably rather stay awake all night in a roach-infested $50-a-night motel than impose on the kindness and home comforts of a friendly couchsurfer. &nbsp;And we don't all have passes to SXSWi yet or train passes. &nbsp;However we've secured one &pound;3,000 package of support and are finalising one for &pound;1250, we're having our party tomorrow, we have some nice kit from Nokia and Canon and there are still open doors on other potential <a href="http://tuttle2texas.posterous.com/be-a-sponsor-of-the-day">sponsors of the day</a> (please twist corporate arms where you can but not so hard that they're unable to sign-off some cash for us).</div>
<p />
<div>We've had &pound;50 today in personal donations - that makes my heart sing even more, thank you <a href="http://twitter.com/frankie_ecap">@frankie_ecap</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/tessybritton">@tessybritton</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/artsmonkey1">@ArtsMonkey1</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/fj">@fj</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(STOP PRESS: and while I was writing this post <a href="http://twitter.com/darenBBC">@darenBBC</a> )- I will send a postcard from <a href="http://tuttle2texas.posterous.com/nailing-down-the-itinerary-part-1">any of our stop-off cities</a> on the route to anyone who plops at least &pound;5 or $10 in our <a href="http://tuttle2texas.chipin.com">fund</a>.</div>
<p />
<div>But the main thing I want to show with this, is that, just as with Tuttle (and arguably everything in life), there's no such thing as failure - it's all part of the adventure and so we will continue to collect money and raise funds right up until the end of the trip if that's what we need to do - in fact I shan't be surprised if some potential sponsors are still holding back until they can actually see how much noise we really make - which fine - I'd much people gave us money becasue of what we actually do than what forecast numbers we can come up with to satisfy the ROI crowd.</div>
