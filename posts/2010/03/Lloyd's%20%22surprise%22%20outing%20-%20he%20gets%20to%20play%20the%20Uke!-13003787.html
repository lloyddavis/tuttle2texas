<div class='post_body'><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Lloyd Davis&rsquo;s &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; on Saturday last was to go to a massive gated complex for &lsquo;seniors&rsquo;, meet their Ukelele Group and play with them and for them.&nbsp; But we didn&rsquo;t know that before we got there; just that Lloyd had to bring his uke and I was asked to bring my guitar.&nbsp; Put like that it sounds a bit stark and unfriendly.&nbsp; It was anything but.</span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">We were well over an hour late.&nbsp; Our train from New York to Washington was delayed; we got stuck in an awful traffic jam.&nbsp; We were crammed into a small car with instruments, cameras, a big tripod bag and rucksacks.&nbsp; I hate being late nearly as much as a Japanese person hates being late.&nbsp; We were unpardonably late.&nbsp; So we turned off the freeway, up the hill and saw the buildings; large apartment blocks with high-level enclosed walkways between them, surrounded by car parks and linked by access roads.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go up the hill, straight through the four-way stop, right at the T; you&rsquo;ll see a pond and a gazebo on the right.&nbsp; The Village Center is right in front&rdquo; said the laconic guard before looking into the car and making remarks along the lines of &ldquo;I never knew you could get a whole family in one o&rsquo; them things&rdquo;.</span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">At first, I was shocked at the place - the scale of it and the closed-off nature of a gated community on the outskirts of Washington DC - not something I&rsquo;m familiar with from the UK.&nbsp; It made me think of being on a cruise; but on a vast brick and concrete liner firmly rooted to the Maryland earth.&nbsp; We followed the instructions, watching the little blue blob of the GPS on the iPhone ping away.&nbsp; In the distance we saw a small red-clad figure, waving.&nbsp; The red was a Hawaiian shirt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ahh . . .&rdquo; said Lloyd like the noise of a penny dropping into treacle.&nbsp; I started to feel nervous.</span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">We groaningly extracted ourselves from the car; not easily or quickly.&nbsp; The lady in the red Hawaiian shirt was one of our hosts.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope they&rsquo;re all still there; we eat early round here.&rdquo; she said, ushering us through the reception area and up a wide staircase.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know how Lloyd was coping with his &lsquo;surprise&rsquo; - Michelle was filming him and I was a bit ahead of that and trying to deal with my own reactions to the place.&nbsp; That&rsquo;ll be a piece of video worth watching!</span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">We went into the Music Room and found about 15 people with ukes and a lady sitting behind a piano at the front of the room.&nbsp; All of them were wearing bright Hawaiian shirts; cheerful friendly faces.&nbsp; We apologised for being so late.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d obviously been waiting, apparently with the patience of the wise; and though I felt bad and awkward about being late; they kindly made it clear that that said more about me than about them.</span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">Lloyd was an instant hit, as you&rsquo;d expect.&nbsp; He got out his uke, stood at the front of the room, chatted and tuned, a bit of banter - he didn&rsquo;t look nervous.&nbsp; I found a space at the back of the room, next to a guy with a lovely-looking baritone uke (which was even better when he played it).&nbsp; Just along from me were two other blokes.&nbsp; I thought &ldquo;That&rsquo;s ok, I can hide at the back!&rdquo;.&nbsp; I unpacked and tuned my travel guitar - a normal sized guitar fretboard with acoustic strings and action, but a reduced-size soundbox; pretty and soft-voiced, delicate.&nbsp; It should fit ok with the ukes.&nbsp; </span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">They suggested that Lloyd play for them but he said &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we find something we can all play; what do you suggest?&rdquo;.&nbsp; So they handed round song sheets and we had a go at &ldquo;Alexander&rsquo;s Ragtime Band&rdquo;.</span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">Away we went; I could hear the baritone uke playing under the rest of the ukes, could hear the guys to my right singing the harmonies - one of them with a pure tenor.&nbsp; I found a space to sing and, maybe, play a bit; finding chords and bass notes and singing the harmonies with Lloyd and my friends at the back.&nbsp; The lady at the piano kept us to time with a basic approach, adding in supportive runs and little flourishes that spoke of a talent reined back.&nbsp; I remember thinking &ldquo;Wow, I&rsquo;d like to hear her play what she usually plays . . .&rdquo;.&nbsp; </span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">This somewhat bald and factual account leaves out the feeling in the room.&nbsp; Which was extraordinary.&nbsp; A mix of players and abilities; some of whom have only recently started playing and others who have played for a long time.&nbsp; It turns out that the lady at the piano is an accomplished former professional who had her own girl band decades ago.&nbsp; Her husband was a band-leader and saxophonist.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t matter that some of us weren&rsquo;t particularly good (and I include myself in this statement).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not the kind of music know how to play, and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever sat in with 15 ukes before!&nbsp; Stick me in a pub session with the fiddles and the Irish tunes and I&rsquo;m yer man.&nbsp; But 30s songs and ragtime, well, that&rsquo;s a different matter.&nbsp; And, d&rsquo;you know it didn&rsquo;t matter a bit.&nbsp; Because we were all there having a go; for the music and for the hell of it.</span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">I can&rsquo;t, sitting here writing this later the same evening, remember the other tunes we played - seems odd I know but I was listening and concentrating so hard - trying to find the space to play and not mess up.&nbsp; I leant on the baritone guy - and tried to follow him.&nbsp; He played with a delicate and beautiful tone - chording the harmonies under the melody.&nbsp; Later, I talked to him and found out that he&rsquo;s played the guitar and the uke since he was a teenager.&nbsp; </span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">Lloyd did his stuff next - and he played and sang with an openness and joy that captivated the room.&nbsp; His first song &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s sorry now?&rdquo; brought a gasp from a lady at the back of the room - she was still; listening and remembering; an important song for her and she cried a little bit, I think.&nbsp; He sang the old songs that they knew.&nbsp; He played in a way that helped to understand how to play better and how to live in the music.&nbsp; I can quite understand, as you read this, that you might think I&rsquo;m exaggerating or that it sounds a bit corny.&nbsp; But the emotion in the room was palpable and deep and the communication was at a level difficult to describe; it was touching.&nbsp; Happy and sad at the same time, the music bridging the present and the past simultaneously, and the songs linking us together irrespective of age or ability.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never forget it.</span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">We had to stop for a bit after that.&nbsp; There was a bit of chat.&nbsp; Heather asked some questions and Michelle filmed.&nbsp; We found out a bit about the group; why they&rsquo;d formed, how often they meet.&nbsp; They perform. They&rsquo;re on Youtube.&nbsp; </span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">I was asked to sing.&nbsp; Now, being brought up in an Irish family, everyone has a song or two, a party piece.&nbsp; These circumstances, I find difficult - with my family I sing; with people I don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s harder.&nbsp; I thought of 3 or 4 songs I could do and then settled on the Night Visiting Song.&nbsp; And to those of you who know me; no, I didn&rsquo;t forget any of the words nor did I get the verses in the wrong order (a fluke, obviously).&nbsp; I was pretty nervous but it seemed to go ok.&nbsp; </span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">Lloyd finished off with a number and then, as is a tradition with this group, they all joined in with &ldquo;Happy Trails&rdquo;.&nbsp; </span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">Afterwards, we had an early dinner with three of the ladies in an enormous dining room filled with circular tables.&nbsp; They talked about their lives, both past and present - one of them worked for NASA and she said she didn&rsquo;t want the video on a DVD - she&rsquo;d prefer a flash drive.&nbsp; They talked to us about the place and the community in and around it.&nbsp; About their own independence and the levels of care they can design for themselves (from largely independent living through to fulltime nursing care).&nbsp; And yes, the seniors are well-to-do people; I don&rsquo;t see how they could afford to live in this place otherwise.&nbsp; The people I spoke to seemed mostly to be former professional people, now retired and in control of their lives.&nbsp; </span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">The young people serving and clearing tables go to local high schools; they get paid for the work and once they&rsquo;ve worked there for a while, they can qualify for college scholarships funded by the seniors.&nbsp; I watched the movement of people around the dining room, young and old, and the way they smiled and talked to each other.&nbsp; Between the people serving and their elders there appeared to be a feeling of mutual respect.&nbsp; It felt authentic.</span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">As we left the dining table, I offered my arm to the lady whose idea it was to start the Ukelele Group.&nbsp; She has a buggy to get around in she had parked nearby.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d talked to her&nbsp; across the table over dinner.&nbsp; A determined and intelligent person.&nbsp; Funnily enough, I don&rsquo;t think any of us asked her what she used to do.&nbsp; I think because she is so much in the present - it didn&rsquo;t occur to us.&nbsp; As she took my arm, I sensed the strength in her - not physical strength; but strength of will and clarity and determination.&nbsp; </span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">At the top of the stairs, we passed a large banner, red and cheerful with &ldquo;Blizzard 2010&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; on it.&nbsp; All over the banner were little messages written by the residents to the staff.&nbsp; The Washington area recently had about 5 ft of snow.&nbsp; Overnight.&nbsp; The staff came in, through snowdrifts and ice.&nbsp; One of the servers walked several miles to get there because he wanted to make sure the elderly people he cared for were ok.&nbsp; Many staff stayed overnight.&nbsp; Everybody mucked in.&nbsp; The messages on the banner were about that.&nbsp; </span><p /><span style="font-size: medium;">Oh, and the early dinner.&nbsp; It turns out that there are rules that apply to High School students and the hours and times they are allowed to work.&nbsp; By starting dinner at 4pm and running till 7pm, it means that students can work and finish at the right time.&nbsp; And, as one of our hosts said &ldquo;Lots of us like to eat early once we get a bit older.&rdquo;</span><p /><br /></p></div>

<div class='response_body'>Good to hear Lloyds years at drama school have not been wasted. although am disappointed he didn't give them his audition piece as an added extra. Isn't music a wonderful thing, isn't there such power in the language of music and the camaraderie of it's community - a perfect accompaniement to a social media mission such as Tuttle2Tex. Singing for your early dinner, wonder what you'd have to do for a nights B&B at the Waldorf?</div>
