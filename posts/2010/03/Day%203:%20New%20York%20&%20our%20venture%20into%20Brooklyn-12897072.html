<div class='post_body'><p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It&rsquo;s Day 5 of Tuttle2Texas and we&rsquo;re leaving NYC about an hour late to Washington.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;re already leaving New York as it feels like we were just getting started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This leg of the trip Michelle and I stayed with Nick and Martha Desbiens and their 2 year old son Adrian. When we arrived on Thursday, we travelled out to Brooklyn where Nick and Martha lived near Grand Army Plaza/ <a href="http://www.prospectpark.org/">Prospect Park</a>. After introductions and making of fake pizza with Adrian, Michelle and I headed out to get some New York shots before we lost the light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately we did lose it in the end as we were having so much fun chatting with Martha, that by the time we got into Manhattan, it was dusk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Waiting for it to get a bit darker, Michelle and I cruised around the tip of central park, saw the horse and carriages lined up along the road, and rounded back to Carnegie Hall. Then travelling south we headed towards the daylight, I mean lights of time square, getting night shots along the way. Times Square was packed with people and according to our hosts, was only pedestrianised 3 months ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think that was a wise decision as I looked around at all the tourists with their cameras as they wandered the square.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">As it was New York and it was night, pretzels were in order which is why Michelle and I had to partake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn&rsquo;t as good as we thought they would be (maybe they needed to be heated up a bit more?) but they were salty and covered in mustard so it was a good between meal snack.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">Nick and Martha have been in their Brooklyn flat for the last year and a half and there seems to be tons of room for their son and them to live.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s still very small so there&rsquo;s not enough room to really play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I now understand why there are play centres and why moms and nannies are always sitting in parks in the movies. We settled on Sushi for dinner and Michelle and I picked up some Brooklyn Pale Ale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I had tried UFO and Samuel Adams in Boston, I had to try something local in New York.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We actually asked a man in the local grocery store what we should get as there were about 5 coolers full of beer in the shop we went into.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Supposedly, Brooklyn Lager is good for a spicy meal and Brooklyn Pale Ale is perfect for a rich meal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s always good to know local beers like ones from the Brooklyn Brewery&nbsp;&ndash; it makes it easier to impress locals on my next visit.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">We interviewed the Desbiens the first night we met and Nick commented on how it was the first time he had ever thought or spoke that long about how he used the internet and social media. The next day&hellip;he started following me on Twitter.</span></span></p></div>
