<div class='post_body'>So actually we&#39;re just going to leave Boston in a couple of hours and I&#39;m realising that we&#39;ve put out very little so far - we&#39;ve been active on twitter, but the combination of jetlag, an overfilled schedule and unfamiliarity with the city, despite lovely help from Mike Oh &amp; Kera Murphy and the gang at TechSuperpowers has meant it&#39;s been really difficult to get some real writing done.  <p /><div>Well that should be what the train journey&#39;s are for.  In the meantime I&#39;m waking up in Boston again, it&#39;s cold, but not much colder than London has been and today we have no snow.  </div><p /><div>To recap what we&#39;ve done as placeholders for longer reflections later:</div><p /><div>Last night we did #TuttleBoston at the digilounge we had lots of lovely people come along to cheer us on our way.  We need some easy way of collating those people&#39;s details so that we can thank them and point you to them.  I guess some of it is in eventbrite....</div> <p /><div>At lunchtime we were the guests of MIT at Venture Cafe in the Cambridge Innovation Center - great simple human-scale conversation and good to meet Carrie Stalder, Cyndi Hernandez, Michael Davies, Phil Wyman and Mary <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; color: rgb(136, 136, 136);">Nykoruk and Peter Hirst joined us again.  Carrie&#39;s plans for Venture Cafe - bringing entrepreneurs together to talk about &quot;stuff&quot; chimed very well with what we were thinking when we talked about a Social Media Cafe all those years ago.</span></div> <p /><div><span style="border-collapse: collapse;">Before lunch David Weinberger popped into the digilounge to hear about Tuttle &amp; Tuttle Consulting as part of research for his latest book - fascinating stuff about how our concept of knowledge  is taking on the characteristics of the network.  I told the too long version of the creation story - we could really have done with longer, but hey, we have e-mail!  We also realised we&#39;d inadvertently put some inflexibility into the shooting of the documentary.  Heather has standard copyright release forms because the film she will make is intended for TV and that will require all the rights to be nailed down old skool.  Unsurprisingly, enlightened individuals like David are not so keen on being interviewed on camera and not having the result released under creative commons.  Is fine.  We now know there are two streams - content that will be free to use (we haven&#39;t agreed between us which licence is best to use btw - that might be a discussion for this upcoming train ride)  and stuff that only makes it into the TV film.  And of course, there will probably actually be more than one film - it seems cool actually that  you might get less value from watching the copyright version because the cool folks who insist on CC are only in the free one :)</span></div> <p /><div><span style="border-collapse: collapse;">Oh there&#39;s so much more to say about all of these, but I have to run to get a train to New York, New York.</span></div> <p /><div><span style="border-collapse: collapse;">Hot diggity dog!<br /> </span> <br /></div></div>
