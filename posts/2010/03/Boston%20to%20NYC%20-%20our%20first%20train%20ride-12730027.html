<div class='post_body'><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Woah, this is a shaky old train. Difficult to type because the tray is up close to me but anyway it&#39;s better than having it on my lap. The Amtrak trains are like big tin cans, they look like they&#39;re just slats of aluminium stapled together. And this ride south out of Boston feels like it too. Everything rattles and judders.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">It&#39;s snowing outside and we&#39;re getting out of the city and into more countryside space. We just stopped at a station called Route 128 – the train station is named after a road? OK it&#39;s also University Park.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I&#39;m unreasonably excited about being on an American train. I&#39;ve lived around London and commuted for 20 years. I know what trains are like, and I&#39;m used to the experience. However, this feels weirdly different. The conductor we met was friendly and um, American, confidently in charge, rather than being officious and jobsworthy.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I realised what it was that I was getting excited about - American rail reminds me of Casey Jones. Casey Jones was to me an exciting and exotic part of my television childhood. Plucky Alan Ladd driving a train regardless of bandits and rockfalls and anything else that might have gotten in his way He always got through. He just did. Anyway he wasn&#39;t a train driver he was an Engineer – American usage, I blame the literal German immigrants – he drives and engine so he must be an engineer. Maybe that&#39;s what we originally meant by engineer too. Maybe i&#39;m jetlagged and I&#39;m writing stuff that I ordinarily wouldn&#39;t let out of my head. And of course now I&#39;ve also got the theme to the show stuck in my head, squeezing out Chatanooga Choo Choo - “Casey Jones, steamin&#39; and a&#39; rollin&#39;”</p></div>
