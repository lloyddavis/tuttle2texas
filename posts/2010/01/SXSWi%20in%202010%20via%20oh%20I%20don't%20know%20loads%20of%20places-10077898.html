<div class='post_body'><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/3349666913/" title="homage to wankergirl by Lloyd Davis, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3633/3349666913_25d00812f8_m.jpg" align="right" height="180" alt="homage to wankergirl" width="240" /></a>So here's my poorly thought-out, unplanned, half-baked, undetailed, but totally awesome idea for the Spring of 2010.</p>
<p>I'll be attending <a href="http://sxsw.com">SXSWi</a> in Austin, Texas again.  My <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/4544">panel was not picked</a>, but emotion aside all that means is that I'll have to pay $blah or so for a ticket. So I'm definitely still going to go - it's just well, you know, <a href="http://www.broadstuff.com/archives/1612-SXSW-the-Spice-Girl-Cometh.html">too lovely and awesome</a> not to.</p>
<p>Last year we flew over a few days before and had some holiday time hanging out and getting acclimatimed and then flew back the day after interactive closed.</p>
<p>This time I want to take it a bit more gently.  Here are the bare bones of the evil plan, which I'd prefer to do with a gang of tuttle-istas if we can find ways of funding it:</p>
<p>1.  Find the shortest flight to North America possible (does that mean least-polluting? I don't know but that seems like a good aim to bear in mind) and fly at least a week before SXSWi opens ie arrive March 5th at the latest.</p>
<p>2.  Devise a series of train journeys from wherever I land, down to Austin, preferably going via New Orleans to visit that good friend of Tuttle, <a href="http://www.taylordavidson.com/writing/">Mr Taylor Davidson</a> and see how his Crescent City adventure is panning out.  Yes, you read that right, train journeys.  I understand that the US train system is not quite as beautiful or efficient as <a href="http://perfectpath.co.uk/2009/08/18/interrail-day-7/">its European sisters</a>.  However, train travel rocks, it just does.</p>
<p>3.  At stopping places throughout the journey hold <a href="http://perfectpath.co.uk/2009/07/09/what-i-did-at-rebootbritain/">Human-scale Conversation</a> sessions with local people talking about differences between US and British culture - not trying to solve anything particularly, just getting the subject out on the table and seeing what comes of it.  There will be heavy-duty social reporting of these conversations. Note that the format has been refined since July with some extra flourishes - <a href="http://digitalcitizen.posterous.com/social-planet-conversations">this is how I introduced something like it at the Tuttle/Counterpoint event in December</a>.</p>
<p>4.  Once in Austin, continue to hold Human-scale Conversation sessions on the same subject and present <a href="http://fionacullinan.com/2009/03/hashtag-kebab-aka-%E2%80%98the-art-of-conference-jacking%E2%80%99/">#kebab-style</a> what we heard, found, learned, saw along the way.</p>
<p>5.  Make our way back to the east coast overland again, putting together a documentary film from the footage shot during the first part of the trip, so that we have something ready to show when we get back to London.</p>
<p>Howzat grab ya?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/3356939241/" title="150320091095 by Lloyd Davis, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3635/3356939241_5de80e6f57_m.jpg" height="180" alt="150320091095" width="240" /></a></p>
<p>Here's 8 ways you can help (and I'm sure you'll come up with more)</p>
<p>1. Tell me how you'd improve on the plans and make them even more exciting.</p>
<p>2. Tell me why this is oh so very wrong-headed, misguided and stupid (I won't listen very much, but I'd rather ask you for this than you just provide it out of the blue!).</p>
<p>3. Help me work out rough costings for each variation.</p>
<p>4. Provide money (just loads of it, regardless of the costs!)</p>
<p>5. Suggest routes and interesting stopover points, tell me why you think it's interesting.</p>
<p>6. Volunteer to tag along and tell me how we'd pay for that.</p>
<p>7. Find other supporters with more money than time who'd like to see this happen.</p>
<p>8. Introduce me to sponsors who might provide help in terms of cash, food, shelter, transport as well as social reporting equipment.</p></div>
