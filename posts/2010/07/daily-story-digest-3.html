It's home from home.<p /> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevegarfield/4406365590"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2789/4406365590_7e9cb821b3_b.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a><p /><span class="title" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #000080; font-family: Trebuchet MS; line-height: 150%;">"Livestreams and Ukulele"</span><p />  In the evening, we did #TuttleBoston in the lovely DigiLounge.&nbsp; Mike and Kera did us proud with food and drink for all.&nbsp; Brian tucked himself away in a corner and then proudly announced that we were livestreaming to the internetz - he then carried on a great tuttle tradition of talking to people somewhere else in the world while attending a face to face meetup.&nbsp; I think we all had a go at manning the live stream, with the bizarre thing being that practically everyone watching was in the UK and it was 7pm EST/midnight GMT when we started.&nbsp; We also witnessed the emergence of a new livestreaming double act in the shape of Heather and <a href="http://stevegarfield.com/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">Steve Garfield</a>.&nbsp; Fortunately for the cultural edification of future generations, the whole thing <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/5166245" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">is archived here</a>.<p />  This was one of the things I wanted to really test out on this trip, whether people would come out on a snowy evening in March to meet some crazy English (OK and Irish) and Canadian folk,&nbsp; just because they'd seen people talking about it on Twitter - yup, people are just as funny in America as they are in London!<p />  It was also time to try out the "thank you" present of entertaining them with my singing and ukulele - you can hear how it went down on <a href="http://audioboo.fm/boos/102265-lloyd-entertaining-the-tuttleboston-crew-tuttle2texas" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">Heather's audioboo</a>.&nbsp; All too soon it was time for bed, we had a train to catch in the morning.<p />  (photo credit cc <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/deed.en_GB" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">by-nc-sa</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevegarfield/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">Steve Garfield</a>)<p /> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/4475899987"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2706/4475899987_18c88fb47a_b.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a><p /><span class="title" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #000080; font-family: Trebuchet MS; line-height: 150%;">"All Aboard!"</span><p />  So just as I was starting to feel I knew where I was and that things were OK and working as expected, we throw ourselves off another cliff.&nbsp; It's time to get our first train.&nbsp; Why is this difficult?&nbsp; I did a 40 minute train commute from Surrey into London pretty much every day for about 15 years.&nbsp; I've travelled on all the mainlines in the UK and delved into some of the most obscure branches too.&nbsp; I spent a couple of weeks last year<a href="http://perfectpath.co.uk/tag/interrail/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;"> travelling around Europe</a> on an Interrail pass.&nbsp; I know how to travel on trains, I like travelling on trains, why am I restless and irritable waiting for this Amtrak from Boston down to New York City?<p />  Because I don't know what I don't know.&nbsp; My fear of making an awful faux-pas is heightened.&nbsp; Have I got the right ticket?&nbsp; What are those <a href="http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer/Page/1241267362176/1237405732517" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">Red Caps</a> up to?&nbsp; Do they expect an extortionate tip for taking your luggage to the train?&nbsp; Will they set fire to it in disgust if you give them a couple of bucks instead of five?&nbsp; How do we know which is our train?&nbsp; Do we really need to be here 30 minutes before departure?&nbsp; What will happen if we aren't? How does queueing work in this country?&nbsp; Am I in the way?&nbsp; What don't I know that is suddenly and unexpectedly going to get me into trouble?<p />  Then it hits me.&nbsp; I am one of those people that, back in London, I stand behind and tut at. I am a foreigner who hasn't a clue and I forgive every stupid Italian I've ever wanted to strangle, every Yank whose baseball cap I wanted to stuff in their loud mouths, every Yorkshireman that I've wanted to scream at "WAKE UP! LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOING".&nbsp;&nbsp; I am filled with forgiveness for them all and for myself and I'm ready to just go and see how it all works.<p />  OMG, they really do shout "All Aboooooaaaard!"<p /> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/4422022065"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4052/4422022065_2cbeb5a882_b.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a><p /><span class="title" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #000080; font-family: Trebuchet MS; line-height: 150%;">"Next Stop: Big Apple"</span><p />  "The Amtrak trains are like big tin cans, they look like they're just slats of aluminium stapled together."&nbsp; <a href="http://tuttle2texas.posterous.com/boston-to-nyc-our-first-train-ride" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">I wrote as we juddered our way</a> down along the New England coastline.&nbsp; Of course they're not.&nbsp; They're actually slats of aluminum stapled together.<p />  This first leg reminded me how difficult it is to actually write while&nbsp; you're on a train.&nbsp; When rushing around a city it feels like the train time's going to be a great time to "get all this down" - actually, there's still plenty going on that you don't want to miss.&nbsp; What does the countryside look like between Boston and New York?&nbsp; I realise that there are lots of big empty chunks in my conceptual map of the United States that are going to get filled on this trip - I knew Boston was going to be a little Good Will Hunting, and I expected NYC to be Kojak and Starsky and Hutch but what's inbetween?&nbsp;&nbsp; Well it turns out, for a British Rail traveller, that it's quite like that bit of the South Wales coast beyond Cardiff - Port Talbot and Swansea, tired old industrial ports and factories interspersed with breathtaking natural beauty - not lush mountainsides of course, still gorgeous, but different, American.<p />  Then before we know it, and just as I was ready for a little snooze, there's the island of Manhattan our of the right hand window.&nbsp; Rarely photographed from this angle, and I can see why - it didn't inspire me to leap out of my seat and snap away.&nbsp; Approaching from the north-east by rail doesn't capture it's best side, but yes, that's definitely New York.<p />  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lloyd-davis/4422814520"><img class="posterous_download_image" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4001/4422814520_c4b5a39c93_b.jpg" border="0" width="500" /></a><p /><span class="title" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #000080; font-family: Trebuchet MS; line-height: 150%;">"Welcome to 7th Avenue!"</span><p />  So this is my postcard-y shot from the <a href="http://www.bartleboglehegarty.com/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">BBH offices</a> down towards the bottom of 6th Avenue.&nbsp; Don't talk to me about postcards.&nbsp; if you want to hear my postcards from New York story, talk to <a href="http://blarmcast.com/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">Dana</a> - she tells it with great relish and glee...<p />  Anyway, back to getting off the train.&nbsp; Penn Station isn't really like any station in London.&nbsp; I guess its closest British counterpart would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_New_Street_railway_station" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">New St in Birmingham</a> in that it's dirty,&nbsp; mostly underground and you come out into a tired shopping centre full of crazy people whose accent you can't understand.&nbsp; Classy.&nbsp; Which&nbsp; reminds me of Big Cultural Difference #2 - the significantly larger number of people clearly suffering from mental health problems and living (or at least begging) on the streets.&nbsp; My assumption is that the NHS tidies much of this away - it's not that we're any less crazy, just that we can get our drugs for free.<p />  My senses already heightened by men wearing two overcoats tied up with string, I emerged onto 7th Avenue ready to see what the isle of Manhattan had to offer.&nbsp; Well the first thing was a couple arguing - not the sort of low-level passive aggressive bickering you see from couples in IKEA - no, full on, sassy. "you ain't nevah gonna see yo' children agin mofo" screaming match - just marching straight through the tourists.&nbsp; Tired, jetlagged, uptight and suffering from an imagination overfed with way too many nights under the blankets reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Spider-Man_%28comic_book%29" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">Amazing Spiderman</a> as a youngster, I really didn't know whether to laugh out loud or hit the deck because the shooting was going to start.&nbsp; So I looked to Dana.&nbsp; Who was laughing.&nbsp; Not at the couple but at me, for being such an out-of-towner.&nbsp;<p />  Oh New York!</p>
