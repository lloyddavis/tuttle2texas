<div class='post_body'><p>I'm having a go at using a short daily e-mail to make a sort of illustrated serial out of stories from the trip.  I'm going to publish a digest of them here every week.  This is the first.</p>
<p>If you'd like to get these straight to your mailbox every weekday morning you can <a href="http://eepurl.com/GcpJ" title="mailing list sign-up" target="_blank">sign up here</a>.</p>
<p>Please help me improve on this - let me know in the comments what you like and what could be better - either about the daily e-mails or this digest format.</p>

<p><span class="title" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #000080; font-family: Trebuchet MS; line-height: 150%;">"To begin  at the beginning..."</span></p>
<p>"To begin at the beginning" that's  all I've got in my head, Richard  Burton's voice booming out of one of  those big wooden loudspeakers.  But  what is the true beginning of this  tale of risk, adventure, romance and  laughter?  Mmmm... well let's just  start with a conversation between friends.  If we have to backtrack  at  all then we will, but for now let's start with December 3rd 2009.  We   (assorted members of the <a href="http://tuttleclub.wordpress.com/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">Tuttle Club</a>) are at the <a href="http://www.ica.org.uk/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">ICA</a> celebrating the  completion of some fascinating work  with the British Council's  thinktank, <a href="http://www.counterpoint-online.org/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">Counterpoint</a>,  applying our social artistry and consulting  skills to their complex  organisational environment and helping them find  new ways to engage  with people online.  <p />  We're talking.  We're tuttlers,  that's  what we do.  And so the story emerges from a conversation.  I  say  something like "I want to go to <a href="http://sxsw.com/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">SXSWi</a> again this year, but I don't  want to just flit in and out.  Maybe we  could fly to somewhere over on  the east coast and then trek across  somehow."  Yes! voices are raised.   Yes! and little eyes light up.  <a href="http://stevelawson.net/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">Steve Lawson</a> talks  about his low-carbon  touring approach.  Sara Haq reminds us of the <a href="http://www.alexiagoethegallery.com/x/exhibitions.html?exid=31&amp;atid=11" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">Overland Project</a>.  Yes!  we'd be up for something like  that.  Yes! we could make a movie as we go  along.  And I have the  familiar sick feeling beginning deep within that  we've started  something that will soon have irresistible momentum.   Something a bit  scary, but exhilarating.  A new piece of social art.<p />  Here we go  again...</p>

<p><span class="title" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #000080; font-family: Trebuchet MS; line-height: 150%;">"Practicalities"</span></p>
<p>So we have an idea, a plan, a scheme.  It's exciting and we're all  up for it. Yeah!</p>
<p>And so to practicalities.  But first we have to  descend through a layer of fantasy practicalities - the cool ways that  someone else once did something quite similar to this but, well, "who  knows unless we try, right?"</p>
<p>These are not actually  practicalities at all, they're still part of imagining.  They're a  method we use to convince ourselves that we're not crazy even if we've  just had a crazy idea.  They're more justifications than practicalities.   But that's not always a bad thing and anyway they also open you up to  even more audacious possibilities, thus: "Then if we do that, it means  we could probably do this other thing too and that would *totally*  rock."</p>
<p>We really do need to get down to practicalities though, oh  yes.  Which basically means: "Um. How much is this going to cost?   Where might we get the money? No, really, where?  What do we actually  have that we can depend on? Hmmmmm...this may be trickier than we  thought."</p>

<p><span class="title" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #000080; font-family: Trebuchet MS; line-height: 150%;">"The  Point"</span><p />Days pass, weeks pass... oh. my. goodness! we're at  the point. The point of no return.  The point of make or break.  The  time when we decide whether we're going to do this thing or slink off  into the February gloom and start planning for something else, something  less daring, something more boring.<p />Of course, three months down  the line, we all know that we pushed ahead, pulled ourselves up by our  bootstraps and went for it.  But there really was a time when I didn't  know if we were going or not.  In truth, this "point" stretched out over  a few weeks, and, at least from my own point of view, the period of  uncertainty didn't really end until I was sitting on Long Beach enjoying  the Californian spring sunshine.  But in London, in February, Brian,  Heather and I had to decide whether to pull the plug or to embrace the  uncertainty, to set off and let the story unfold, even if that involved  spending our own money and a lot of "whistling in the dark".<p />Well  I wrote in the <a href="http://tuttleclub.wordpress.com/2009/04/09/tuttle-club-annual-report-2009/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">first Tuttle Annual Report:</a> "<em>We don't know how all of  this will turn out. We've never known, to be honest, but at times when  we had to make a decision (like moving location to the ICA for example) I  was happy to hold the uncertainty on the group's behalf and say that  while I didn't know what was going to happen next, I was sure it would  be OK and that I would do everything in my power to ensure that it was  OK. It's been important for me to establish from the start that I didn't  have all the answers.</em>"<p />And that seemed to fit here too.  So,  y'know, we went.<p />(photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paul_clarke/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">Paul Clarke</a>)</p>

<p><span class="title" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #000080; font-family: Trebuchet MS; line-height: 150%;">"The  Kindness of Strangers"</span><p />Dealing with uncertainty was not  just about taking a deep breath and jumping in.<p />This diagram was  an attempt to draw together what we knew and didn't know before we  started the trip.  My name and Brian's name in red, for example, means  we didn't know where we were going to stay.  This all worked out more  beautifully than we could have imagined but that's a story for another  day.  The blue bits are what we knew about where we would hang out - and  if we didn't know where, then who was helping.<p />So this doesn't  acknowledge the help we got from people before we started.  People we  didn't know at all, who just popped up in our facebook and twitter  streams offering help.  <a href="http://www.stephaniefrost.net/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">Stephanie Frost</a> in Atlanta, Georgia was one of them -  organising a tweetup in a bar for us and persuading Mike at <a href="http://www.ignitionalley.com/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">Ignition Alley</a> to  let us hang out there all day.  I didn't get the importance of this at  first, though I was amazed  and appreciative of all the work people like  Stephanie did for us, I was still wanting to be as self-reliant as  possible - I saw it as a bug, not a feature.  Later on, I would see that  relying on the kindness of strangers, giving people the opportunity to  do something useful and pleasurable and interesting was a vital part of  keeping the flow going and the more we asked for, the more we were  given.<p />So thank you, all of you, not just for what you did, but  for helping me learn that lesson.</p>

<p><span class="title" style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #000080; font-family: Trebuchet MS; line-height: 150%;">"Wanderers"</span><p />  In typical style, I've blundered into telling you the story  without introducing you to the splendid cast of characters.  This is <a href="http://digital-citizen.co.uk/wordpress/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">Brian Condon</a>.   I met Brian at Tuttle about 18 months ago - he is typical of the  fascinating people that Tuttle has introduced me too.  Very clever,  curious, always on the go.  He showed me the plans for what has become  the <a href="http://creative-collaboration.org.uk/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">Centre  for Creative Collaboration</a> (#C4CC) soon after we met.  I smiled and  nodded and told him to let me know how I could help if it ever got off  the ground.  We then worked together on the <a href="http://tuttleclub.wordpress.com/2009/07/15/our-first-consulting-gig/" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">first Tuttle Consulting gig</a> and as a strategy consulting  old-timer, he sees how radical and powerful this approach can be.  He  does great <a href="http://audioboo.fm/brian_condon" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">audioboos</a>.<p />  Brian and I both have migrants in our heritage.  You can tell from  our names that we're not from round here.  So it shouldn't be  surprising that we found ourselves rambling across a big country.<p />  Brian set out first.  He was our scout, going off to see <a href="http://tuttle2texas.posterous.com/social-art-and-healthcare-metaphors" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">interesting things in Toronto</a> to help think about #C4CC  before heading south-east into the Land of the Free.  I first got a real  taste that we were going on a journey and we'd be writing about it,  y'know like real travel writers, when I saw <a href="http://tuttle2texas.posterous.com/crossing-the-border-geographically-and-virtua" style="color: #800000; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: normal;">this post pop up</a> from Brian just after he crossed the  border from Canada.  I was also hit with the realisation of how long our  journey was going to be and how far away it all seemed.  <p />Sitting  in London, on a chilly February day looking at pictures from a man  surrounded by snow,  I started to sweat.</p>
