<div class='post_body'><div style=""><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">I spent Saturday on a train from Toronto in Canada to Albany-Rensselear in New York State. &nbsp; It’s apparently very pretty as the route takes you down the Hudson Valley.&nbsp; But in the aftermath of the biggest and coldest snowstorm of the winter; all I could see was low cloud, and not very far through a grey, misty and very snowy landscape. &nbsp;</span></div><p /><div style=""><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">When we got to Niagara Falls and the Border, we were held for a long time while US Customs and Border Protection checked everybody and everything.&nbsp; I was turned off the train with the other foreigners - and carefully, politely and quietly examined.&nbsp; It was interesting to watch them together; about 5 or 6 officers, working as a team.&nbsp; One of the officers requested the passport of the person sitting next to me on the bench in the waiting area.&nbsp; He took it into the office and when he came back, stood some 3 yards or so away, held up the passport and looked, really looked, at the picture and then even more intently at the person.&nbsp; I noticed his eyes; hard and questioning.&nbsp; He was obviously going through some protocol asking himself “<i>Is this really the person in the passport?” </i>And all of a sudden, he came to a decision, the tension in his stance reduced marginally yet the alert intensity remained. &nbsp;</span></div><p /><div style=""><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">After I had been allowed back on the train with a stamp in my passport (charge $6), I could still see through into the waiting area and beyond that into the office with the computers, cameras and fingerprint machines. The tinted train window partly covered with melting snow obscured any detail and I looked out of the corner of my eye; partly because I didn’t want to look but mostly because I didn’t think the watchers would want to be watched.&nbsp; The lack of detail helped see the patterns of movement and the flow of the work.&nbsp; Very focused,&nbsp; confident in their competent and measured approach.&nbsp; Concentrated in their watchfulness.</span></div><p /><div style=""><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">On the train, some people were getting restless at the time all this was taking.&nbsp; Mostly people who were on the train because they’d been stranded since Thursday by cancelled flights and who were keen to get home.&nbsp; The train guard shrugged - “It’s typical, neither slower nor quicker than usual, just typical.”&nbsp; A smoke break was announced and I clambered off the train onto the trackbed - just to&nbsp; look and walk in the snow.&nbsp; And&nbsp; I made this video:</span></div><p /><div style=""><object height="360" width="480"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=9802741&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=0&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed allowfullscreen="true" src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=9802741&server=vimeo.com&show_title=0&show_byline=0&show_portrait=0&color=ffffff&fullscreen=1" allowscriptaccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="360" width="480"></embed></object></div><p /><div style=""><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;"><b>Crossing a virtual borde</b>r</span></div><p /><div style=""><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">The virtual border is, of course, a fanciful thought.&nbsp; But since I got to North America, the internet has been a bit in short supply.&nbsp; On grounds of extreme cost more than availability; especially the data charges on the iPhone.&nbsp; It costs £6 a MB for data, voice calls are £1.90 a minute and each text is the equivalent of 4 ‘normal’ texts.&nbsp; To reduce the cost, I bought a data ‘bolt-on’ for £50 which gives me a ‘deal’ of £1 per MB until it runs out.&nbsp; Which won’t take very long.&nbsp; O2 sends warning texts frequently reminding that an iPhone using data consumes up to 1 MB per minute.&nbsp; I can’t understand how it can possibly cost that much and that these charges reflect the real costs of service provision. &nbsp;</span></div><p /><div style=""><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">The last time I was in the USA would be about 4 years ago - at a conference in Dallas with WiFi at the conference and in the hotel.&nbsp; Then, while travelling, I used a mobile phone as a modem and was careful.&nbsp; In any event, there wasn’t the constant connectedness that that many of us assume is the norm now. &nbsp;</span></div><p /><div style=""><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">And long ago, when the dotcoms were in mid-boom and President Clinton spoke at a tech conference I was at in San Francisco, my communications costs to dial-up back to a Lotus Notes server in London were higher than my hotel bill (and would be again if I switched on data roaming on my iPhone...). &nbsp;</span></div><p /><div style=""><span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">It’s come as a bit of a shock to me how much I miss the internet.&nbsp; While awake, I’m pretty much connected most of the time. &nbsp; And even when I’m asleep, various devices are storing stuff for me to look at later.&nbsp; Except there’s no later.&nbsp; It’s all on the other side of the border. &nbsp;</span></div><p /><div style="">And this morning, I made this Audioboo:</div><p /><div style=""><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="129" width="400"><param name="movie" value="http://boos.audioboo.fm/swf/fullsize_player.swf" /><param name="scale" value="noscale" /><param name="salign" value="lt" /><param name="bgColor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always" /><param name="wmode" value="window" /><param name="FlashVars" value="mp3Title=An+%27old+school%27+podcast+experience&amp;mp3Time=12.43pm+28+Feb+2010&amp;mp3=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F101338-an-old-school-podcast-experience.mp3&amp;mp3Author=brian_condon&amp;mp3LinkURL=http%3A%2F%2Faudioboo.fm%2Fboos%2F101338-an-old-school-podcast-experience" /><a href="http://audioboo.fm/boos/101338-an-old-school-podcast-experience.mp3">http://audioboo.fm/boos/101338-an-old-school-podcast-experience.mp3</a>">Listen!</object></div></div>
