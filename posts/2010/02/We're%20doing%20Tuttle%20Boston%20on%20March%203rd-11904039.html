<p>Big thanks to Mike Oh at Tech Superpowers in Boston for &nbsp;saying "mi case es su casa" and helping arrange an evening Tuttle tweetup at the start of our trip.</p>
<p>Mike came to Tuttle in London soon after we moved to the ICA I think and he's a regular visitor when he's in London. &nbsp;He and I talked excitedly about his concept of a Digital Lounge in his <a href="http://www.techsuperpowers.com">Mac Support Shop</a> and the idea of doing Tuttle in Boston. &nbsp;I'm really glad that he both managed to open <a href="http://www.techsuperpowers.com/digilounge">Digilounge</a> and to do several tuttle-esque events there. &nbsp;I'm looking forward to coming over and giving it a bit of London flavour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike has said we can use Digilounge as Tuttle HQ for the day. &nbsp;We're also talking to a certain prestigious business school on the other side of the Charles River about running some conversation spaces so we're going to be busy.</p>
<p>And on Wednesday evening we'll be holding Tuttle Boston there for local folk to come together, get some beer (or coffee!) &amp; nibbles (also generously provided by Mr Oh and his team) and join in some great tuttle-ish conversations.</p>
<p>At the moment Heather, Michelle &amp; I are arriving in Boston at around 1.30 on Tuesday March 2nd and Brian is going to get there a little earlier, we think. &nbsp;We'll take it easy on the Tuesday night while we acclimatise to the different gravity conditions of the USA, 18th Century spelling conventions, escaping the metric system etc. &nbsp;But as we're getting the train to New York City on the Thursday morning Wednesday is the big opportunity to meet up with us, so give us a shout and help us get the trip off to a bostin' start (sorry, couldn't help it...)</p></div>
