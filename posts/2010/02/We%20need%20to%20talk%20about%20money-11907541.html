<p>I believe very strongly in organising without organisations - I've held back from incorporating Tuttle for some time for example until we know that we really, really need to. &nbsp;It's a lesson I learned early on as an Information Manager playing with intranets - you need structure, but if you're trying to grow something organic (is there any other way?) you need as little structure as possible to give people some security but not constrain their imaginations for how hugely something can grow.</p>
<p />
<div>However, when we start to do something like this project and we add up all the pennies and gifts in kind that we'll need to get from London to Boston to Austin to LA and back again (plus all the awesome stuff in between) we realise that we need to take some money from larger organisations - top whack, to do the trip comfortably with all the people we'd like to take requires just over &pound;25k - we can and will do it for less but if there are organisations out there who can benefit from the sort of exposure and conversation we create then we're not being of optimum service if we deliberately turn money from them down. &nbsp;And I like to be of optimum service :)</div>
<p />
<div>We have some very promising leads and possibilities for sponsors of the day and I want to announce them as soon as we can. &nbsp;But this is where it gets tricky. &nbsp;It's difficult for small bands of social media companeros like us to engage with organisations like this quietly - the "way they do things" is that you talk quietly to folk and ask for stuff and they go and talk to other folk and you're left sat waiting and unsure and then request after request comes for specific bits of information because the people making the decision don't know anything at all about what you're trying to do. &nbsp; In the meantime we can't say anything in public and so people think that nothing is happening and they (and sometimes we) lose confidence that it will ever come together. &nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>On the other hand the way we normally do things is we blog about stuff and we talk loudly on the internet and in real life and people hear and get pulled in and fired up by our passion and enthusiasm and straight thinking and, lets face it, damned good looks, and they open their hearts and their wallets at the same time.</div>
<p />
<div>So in addition to talking quietly to guys and gals in suits, &nbsp;I'm looking for ways to allow the people who love us and wish us well to be able to give us a fiver without it all being gobbled up in transaction fees. Of course the easiest way to do that with people who are in London is to see them face to face and shake the bucket. &nbsp;For people outside London we need something online and in any case I'd love an easy way of letting people know how much they've raised together - tell me the best way of doing this here in the UK, folks.</div>
<p />
<div>In any case we're doing a fundraiser next Tuesday evening (23rd February) at the <a href="http://creativecollaboration.org.uk" target="_blank">Centre for Creative Collaboration</a>. &nbsp;You won't be surprised to hear that there'll be ukulele and poetry and singing and other bits of performance and we'll have some things to auction or raffle or something (if you have something you want to donate as a raffle prize let me know). We'll get something more detailed up on the wiki later today and point you there from twitter. And if you can't make it, but are coming to Tuttle on Friday, you can slip me a brown envelope there. &nbsp;But for now, put the date in your diary and put a few quid aside to throw at us.</div></div>

<div class='response_body'>You know, looking a that pig, we found a superb way to earn cash at ACID in Australia.  We bought a big plastic box and filled it usually weekly with single serve snack food (fun-size chocolates, sweets, little boxes of sultanas and muesli bars; basically anything that came in a wrapper) and we charged a flat fee for the goods, but a very small payment - the equivalent of about Â£0.30.  Now we mostly bought these in bulk from discount stores and could occasionally get very good rates.  Plus some people didn't have exact change so put in a few more cents/pennies to pay for their energy kick.  At the end of every month there was always more cash than was required.  (We found that when you have a micropayments model, people are prepared to pay a little more than if you charge commercial rates.)  Now at ACID and later at Xenial, we used the profits to pay for Friday drinkies or the odd birthday cake.  But you could inject the profits back in to the Centre.  It won't get you a fortune but it will:<br />(a) keep people at the Centre when they are working rather than send them off elsewhere for a snack; and<br />(b) keep tuttlers happy on a Friday morning!<p>Hope that helps!<br />Cheers,<br />jj<br />PS - we genuinely had a piggy bank to pay for what was both the ACID and the Xenial pig!</p></div>

<div class='response_body'>Thanks Jo, yes, we started asking for contributions to the coffee fund last Friday morning and it worked well, but your idea extends it a bit further.  <p>I'm only just getting over the trauma of the old routine I used to have to go to to extract contributions at the Coach & Horses when we had a weekly rental to find.  This feels very different.  I miss lots of things about using that upstairs room in Greek St, but shaking the bucket like that isn't one of them :)</p></div>
