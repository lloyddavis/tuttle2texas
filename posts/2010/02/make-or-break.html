<div class='post_body'><p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">It's two weeks on Tuesday before we're due to fly out to Boston. &nbsp;We've had lots of fabulous support, of both the moral and the practical kinds. But if we had to leave tomorrow, with the current levels of sponsorship, we would have to be thinking very hard about whether to go or not. &nbsp;If we're still having to worry about where we're sleeping or how much we can spend on food then we're going to be distracted from the important work of connecting with people and having meaningful conversations with them. &nbsp;It might still be a great adventure, but probably a more stressful adventure than we thought we were signing up to. &nbsp; </span></p>
<div><br />
<div>So it's make or break time.</div>
<div>If you're not sure what it is that we're doing this for, take a look at <a href="http://tuttle2texas.posterous.com/getting-back-to-the-real-purpose-of-the-trip" target="_blank">my previous post</a>. &nbsp;The nub of it was:</div>
<div><span style="border-collapse: separate; color: #424037; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 21px;">"The real purpose of the trip is to make connections and build relationships through conversation.&nbsp; That's what Tuttle is really good at... &nbsp;I want to meet old friends with whom I've only ever tweeted.&nbsp; I also want to meet new people and get to know them and think about who we are and what we have in common and how we're all trying to make sense of this world that has been turned upside-down in our lifetimes."</span></div>
<div>This is certainly not something that I can do on my own and it's not even something that Heather, Brian, Al, Patrick, Rose and I or any other individuals can do without your help. &nbsp;</div>
<div>We're taking Tuttle to Texas and that means Tuttle is going to make it happen.</div>
<div>There are two approaches to making things easier - increase funds and decrease costs (by sponsorship in kind - particularly accommodation) - we're pushing on the former but both are valid. &nbsp;Any hotel chains want to put us up all along the route? Anyone know a real person we can talk to in media relations at Amtrak rather than the anonymised e-mail address?</div>
<div>I'm setting up a Facebook fanpage for you to show your support - the more the merrier - it will help show potential sponsors exactly where the love is for this project.</div>
<div>On the londonsocialmediacafe wiki we've set up <a href="http://londonsocialmediacafe.pbworks.com/tuttle2texas" target="_blank">a main page with a description of what we're doing</a> and a set of city pages to collect information about what the plan is for each stop off point on the way to Austin.</div>
<div>Please don't worry about getting the message to the "right" people (although if you can put us in touch directly with decision-makers and budget-holders that's great) get it to as many people as you can - our experience is that the most unexpected connections can often be the most valuable.</div>
<div>Here's some things you can do.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Use the hashtag #tuttle2texas to make a noise.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Pass this message on on Twitter (or Google Buzz or your microblogging platform of choice ) - that we need help, we need friends, we need cash</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Become a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Tuttle-2-Texas/307800467715" target="_blank">fan of the project on Facebook</a></li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Fill in any gaps on the city pages on the wiki - if you're going to be in that city or you know folk who can help organise venues and or give some or all of us hospitality in exchange for being part of a great conversation and a great adventure, please let us know</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Join in with a fundraiser w/c 22nd Feb - pledge objects &amp; services for auction, come ready to spend your cash and invite other rich people...</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Write a message of support about us on your blog, letting people know what we're doing, why you think it's cool and that you'll be watching. Tag it with #tuttle2texas</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Talk to other people about whether and how they can help</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Point Marketing &amp; PR people at the <a href="http://bit.ly/t2t-sotd" target="_blank">daily sponsorship post</a>&nbsp;and tell them why they should support us</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Think of other things you can do to help - just please don't do anything illegal, dishonest or immoral - if in doubt, check with us (not just me) - tweet it with the hashtag #tuttle2texas :)</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Tell us other ways you can think of specifically to raise funds</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Tell us what else you need in order to sell this to people</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Take it easy and keep it in perspective - this is *not* the most important thing in the world right now. &nbsp;If you're having to choose between helping us and helping people survive day to day in Haiti - please, please, please give it to them.</li>
</ul>
