<p>To the wonderful Ontario College of Art and Design for a seminar by Natalie Jeremijenko hosted by Greg van Alynstyne and his colleagues at the sLab of the OCAD (<a href="http://slab.ocad.ca/)">http://slab.ocad.ca/)</a>. <p /> The themes that emerged for me were about co-creation, collaboration and creativity. And the use of a well-known metaphor - that of healthcare, to explore how the 'health' of a neighbourhood can be improved by "Impatients" - who are unwilling to wait for 'the Man' to intervene through legislation. The use of the healthcare metaphor is interesting and, as participants pointed out, as well as the positive aspects of caring, nurturing, curing and well-being; there are also some potentially negative aspects related to the power relationships between clinicians and patients, the financially burdensome nature (some said 'broken' nature) of healthcare in developed countries and the fact that healthcare needs so much in terms of resources (both human and natural). Having said all that, treated carefully and not subject to everyone going into 'metaphor overdrive' - it's a helpful framework for thinking and is being used successfully in New York. <p />  I made an Audioboo yesterday thinking about the seminar and Natalie's approach: <p />

<p /> I also made a liveblog in realtime during the event - this is here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2:38 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> Background to the event (from the sLAb Explorations site): <a href="http://bit.ly/9ILvAS">bit.ly<span class="bittip"><span><span><iframe name="bigurlframe" scrolling="no" class="bigurlframe" rel="" src="http://bit.ly/plugins/iframe?hashUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F9ILvAS" frameborder="0"></iframe></span></span></span></a><p /><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>What happened at Copenhagen, what worked, what didn&rsquo;t, and most importantly &ndash; what now?</strong></span><p />Those who expected decisive agreements and large-scale governmental action from the recent Copenhagen negotiations are disappointed. However, now the emphasis falls on other strategies and technological opportunities we face to coordinate environmental movement, raise the standards of evidence and facilitate diverse responses to environmental challenges. How can distributed sensing and public publishing of data reveal this evidence, support local organizations and actions? How does Pachube &ndash; a kind of Facebook/YouTube for data &ndash; change the game? How can social networking be used in collective sense-making and lifestyle experiments to localize responsibility for environmental health? Is it the big opportunities &ndash; or not?</li>
<li><strong>2:43 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> Greg Van Alystyne (<a href="http://gregvanalstyne.com/)">http://gregvanalstyne.com/)</a> introduces sLab - foresight and a combination of practitioners and academics.  It's about finding ways of collaborating. </li>
<li><strong>2:46 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> Natalie's going to talk about how to aggregate and use data. </li>
<li><strong>2:47 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> Greg introduces #sLab session on Post Copenhagen - what next? <a href="http://twitpic.com/15aelw">http://twitpic.com/15aelw</a></li>
<li><strong>2:47 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em>&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>2:53 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em><span style="font-size: medium;"> <strong>Natalie Jeremijenko;</strong></span><br />About the Speaker [from the sLab site]: <p /><em>Natalie Jeremijenko is an artist whose background includes studies in biochemistry, physics, neuroscience and precision engineering. Jeremijenko is a recipient of the 2008-2009 Van Alen Institute-New York Prize Fellowship in Sustainable Cities and the Social Sciences, and was recently named one of the 40 most influential designers by I.D. Magazine. She is an artist not-in-residence at the Institute for the Future (IFTF) in Palo Alto. Jeremijenko directs the xDesign Environmental Health Clinic [<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/xdesign/">http://www.nyu.edu/projects/xdesign/</a>] at NYU. Her work is described as experimental design, hence xDesign, as it explores opportunities presented by new technologies for non-violent social change. Her research centers on structures of participation in the production of knowledge and information, and the political and social possibilities (and limitations) of information and emerging technologies &mdash; mostly through public experiments.</em><p />Natalie explains that her approach is influenced by the work of John Dewey (he of the system) and his later thinking of exploration and experiment) she also cites a "Bauhaus" moment of involvement in partcipatory democracy.  The ideas of co-creation  and collaboration are also very important aspects of her approach.<p />An analysis of what pediatricians spend their time on in Manhattan - is that a significant number of the diseases they work on have a strong environmental component (air quality for example).</li>
<li><strong>2:57 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> But how do we make these kinds of issues globally relevant and through social media and citizen journalism make these things more visible and actionable.  [Shows a video and other examples]</li>
<li><strong>2:59 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> Use a familiar script to highlight the issues - that's why the health services model is useful.  Not everyone needs to be an environmental activist to engage with the issues.</li>
<li><strong>3:01 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> Natalie gives the example of water quality changes and the increased incidence of certain types of cancer.  They name tadpoles after local officials responsible for water quality and grow them in the same water that the official is responsible for [laughter].</li>
<li><strong>3:03 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> The activists take the tadpoles and introduce them to the officals they are named after  - and they take then tadpole walking.  Creating a kind of 'environmental commons'.  Tadpoles are about 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive than electronic sensors.</li>
<li><strong>3:06 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> Another example is to use domestic mice to monitor environmental health factors - as mice share many things with us - air, water and food. They invented a mousetrap - that enabled mice to self-dose themselves (with stuff like prozac, vodka, zoloc). They take blood samples from the mice and samples of their droppings. An important aspect is that the mice are geographically limited - and so effects are locally verifiable.</li>
<li><strong>3:12 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> The idea is to find monitoring protocols that are simple, accessible and understandable at local level - and air quality is a good example of this.</li>
<li><strong>3:15 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> About 80% of Manhattan's carbon footprint is related to the energy use of buildings </li>

</li>
<li><strong>3:19 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> She covers the idea of the greenlight project - "You may not be able to use solar to run your drier or dishwasher but it can be very useful if you think about it the right way" it is also important to have a conceptual awareness of where the sun is. </li>
<li><strong>3:24 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> The idea of 'surgically' inserting low level trees and shrubs by putting plants in emergency vehicle parking spaces - they can recover quickly and for 99% of the time they are helping to 'cure' the environmental damage - this idea of low parks puts better air quality at the level of the stroller. </li>
<li><strong>3:26 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> Habitat provisioning for butterflies in Manhattan - 3 species of butterfly landed on the No-Park within 15 minutes of it being installed. </li>
<li><strong>3:27 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> There is a strong focus on co-creation and collaboration in the development of these projects.  The term Impatient is used to describe the local people who get involved - because they don't want to wait for the 'official' solution to be done and they want to get on with it.</li>

<li><strong>3:31 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> The Urban Space station is an open source project - and the video is a scale version done in Spain in 2009.</li>
<li><strong>3:36 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> Using solar chimneys to extract carbon black from the atmosphere, extract amorphous carbon and turig it into pencil leads in the Bronx Manhattan and New Jersey.</li>

</li>
<li><strong>3:42 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> This is the video for the No-Parks project.</li>
<li><strong>3:44 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> As water quality improves, and we create more urban green spaces we simultaneously improve our environment and encourage non-human species to 'colonise' our places - this is good for all of us.</li>
<li><strong>3:48 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> Move from a position of trying to find out what you can do rather than over-focus on what you can't do.    For example the idea of nutritionally valid food for fish or other aquatic creatures (rather than white bread).  This food can also be configured to cause the fish to process the heavy metals in a way that 'fixes' them and they fall into the silt - and are no longer bio-avialbale to the animals ind plants in the system.</li>

</li>
<li><strong>3:53 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> She's talking about the Icon Aircraft and the Strap-on flight simulator - as a form of playful engagement.</li>
<li><strong>3:57 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> Re-imagining urban mobility using the Strap-on flight simulator - and using some of these ideas to change our relationships with natural systems. </li>
<li><strong>4:00 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> <em>Question - on models of collaboration with Natural History as an example in 19th C, Astronomy from different locations across the globe.  Protocols are established; the idea of the person as an observer  -and the Map of the Sky produced.  In 20th C we had SETI@home and folding.it.  Can you have the same kind of rigourous standardisation in your projects?</em></li>
<li><strong>4:04 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> She says that by using Pachube for example you can parametrise some of the measurements and data collection protocols.  [She's arguing that by standardising the protocols across wider areas you 'wash out' the ability to involve local people; they end up collecting data for some central authority that loses its relevance to them and which doesn't help understand the system effects at local level].  "You don't have to be a thinking person to work with SETI@home, you're just being a computer by using your spare capacity.</li>
<li><strong>4:05 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> The questioner mentions the idea of 'emancipatory technology' - that it's about access to these.</li>
<li><strong>4:07 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> <em>There is a case for serious science based on some data versus no data at all.  There is new thinking going on - say in the monitoring of air quality; quantity vs quality of data can help to limit errors through extent of data</em></li>
<li><strong>4:13 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> She's saying that the internet demands that we re-examine where the knowledge is in the system - and its probably not in the Library anymore.  It's in the community of practice and the people relationships.</li>
<li><strong>4:14 PM</strong>: <em>brian_condon</em> [That's the end of the seminar - there will be an xCamp session beginning at 1530 - I don't know whether that will be bloggable]</li>
