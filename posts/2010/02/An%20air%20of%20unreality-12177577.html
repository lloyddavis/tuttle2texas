<div class='post_body'>There's an air of unreality about my preparations to go on the tuttle2texas trip. Apart from the obvious problem that I'm not actually going to make it as far as Texas as I will return from New Orleans (via Toronto!) on 13th March. <p /> I've been focused on trying to get the Centre for Creative Collaboration up and running (<a href="http://www.creativecollaboration.org.uk">www.creativecollaboration.org.uk</a>) with my collleagues Thias Martin and Neil Gregory; trying to get the internet into the space (do you realise that you can't actually call BT to order a business phone line - you have to do it all online); working with Lloyd and meeting lots of people who want to visit Acton Street and trying to keep other stuff moving. <p /> The main reason for my trip to North America is to go to see the MaRS Discovery District in Toronto (<a href="http://www.marsdd.com/aboutmars/mission)">http://www.marsdd.com/aboutmars/mission)</a> which combines innovation and social entrepreneurship. I've studied this project from afar and heard about it from people who've been there; but this is the first time I'll be seeing it. I'm also organising other meetings in Toronto. <p /> Then, on Saturday, I'm taking the train to the USA - an overnight stop in Albany; then another train to Boston. Why the train? Why not? <p /> To add to the air of unreality, when I should probably be at home getting sorted for the trip; I'm going to be at the tuttle2texas fund-raiser this evening. See you there!</div>
