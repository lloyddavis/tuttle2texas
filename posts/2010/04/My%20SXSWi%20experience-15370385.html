<div class='post_body'>[<i>Note: I wrote this on Thursday 18th - which means it must have been during the 36-hour train ride.  Don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t post immediately.  Not sure if I still draw the same conclusion - I&#39;m mellowing on it, or maybe the memory is slipping away</i>]<p /> Well it&#39;s over now.<p />This was my second time at SXSW interactive.  I was ready for it to not be as exciting as the first time.  On the first day I took everything in, cameras, phones, laptops, chargers, cables etc. and I got tired out carrying it all around.  On the second day I went minimalist and realised I hadn&#39;t got some things that were really important.  That&#39;s a micro version of my south-by experience - the first time I went I tried to do as much as I could and felt exhausted, this time I took it really easy, only went to a handful of sessions and ended up feeling like I&#39;d probably missed something.<p /> Truth is, everybody misses something.  You cannot do it all. There is too much.  It&#39;s OK to have a light time - I still made lots of new connections and built on existing relationships. However, I also had Taylor&#39;s advice ringing in my ears.<p /> <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Q6MCAieMEUg?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe><p />In addition, the festival has simply grown again.  Whether it&#39;s too big or still not big enough, I don&#39;t know.  My interpretation of what was happening was that there were an awful lot of people there who had been sent by their employer because everyone knows it&#39;s a cool place to be.  They didn&#39;t necessarily know how or why it was cool, but they were there to rub shoulders with the cool kids.  They were not contributing particularly to any coolness - they were there to observe and appreciate it.  And that, I think, is why SXSWi has moved on from being a must-do event to a &quot;might-do if I can get someone to pay for me to go&quot;  </div>
