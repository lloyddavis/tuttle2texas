	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; border-collapse: collapse;">We have a sponsor of the day package.<p />There are 18 full days that we'll be in the States.&nbsp; So here's the offer.<p />As sponsor of the day you get:<br />
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">A blog post before the trip announcing your involvement and describing what you do, how hot/cool/fancy/delicious you are, why people should buy or use your stuff.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">A blog post on the day reminding our readers/viewers/listeners of your support and how awesome you are.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">A video blog post of us using, consuming, looking at or talking about your product (and, naturally, it's complete awesomeness) on the day</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Credits in all content produced on the day ("This post/video/audio was created on Brand X day")</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">If you have branded t-shirts, badges or other clothing and can get it to us in time we will wear it all day long (if it's really nice, some of us may sleep in it).</li>
<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Attendance at a special supporters party on our return including the first screening of our documentary.</li>
</ul>
<br />We hope that you'll understand that you don't get editorial control of other content posted during the day - we're looking to work with people who know they can trust us to do the right thing.<p />All for &pound;1,250 (&pound;1,750 for the 5 days we're actually attending SXSW - 12th-16th March)<p />And you can take as many days as you like and you can choose the day that you sponsor.&nbsp; First come, first served - ie the earlier you confirm, the wider choice of days you'll have. &nbsp;The itinerary is on the wiki. &nbsp;Details of the latter part of the trip will be confirmed shortly.<br /></span></p>]]></content:encoded>
