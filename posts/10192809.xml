	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People keep trying to persuade me to give up the train idea.</p>
<p>But it's *the* idea!!!</p>
<p>Anyhoo.</p>
<p>Just to give you a picture of what we'll be doing, I've been looking at how long it takes to get from place to place.&nbsp; Here's a first stab.</p>
<p>5th&nbsp; arrive Boston from LHR.&nbsp; Run conversation space in collaboration with Boston Tuttle (oops haven't spoken to @hobbesoh about that yet!)</p>
<p>6th Train to NYC leaving about 9am takes 4 hours</p>
<p>7th Train to DC leaving about 10am takes 3.5 hours</p>
<p>8th Train to Atlanta leaves about 6.30pm takes 14 hours overnight (arrives 08.13)</p>
<p>9th Train to New Orleans leaves at 08.38 (tight!) takes 12 hours.</p>
<p>10th Day in NOLA.&nbsp; Oh wait, when's Taylor's gang going over to Austin from NOLA? (a day's drive at least...) Eeek!</p>
<p>Oh.&nbsp; OK.&nbsp; Looks like we ran out of time gonna have to rejig, maybe stretch it back a few days?&nbsp; You see I'd really like to be able to spend some more time in these places on the way.&nbsp; I'd especially prefer to have a day in Atlanta rather than hop off a 14 hour trip and onto another 12 hour one... hmmm....</p>
<p>in the meantime, does anyone know anyone in marketing at Amtrak who might like to give us some free rail passes to do this and publicise their fantastic service all over the interwebs?</p>]]></content:encoded>

And you need to let me help you find awesome people in Atlanta and DC.]]></wp:comment_content>
