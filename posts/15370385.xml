There is too much.  It&#39;s OK to have a light time - I still made lots of new connections and built on existing relationships. However, I also had Taylor&#39;s advice ringing in my ears.<p /> <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Q6MCAieMEUg?wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" height="417" width="500"></iframe><p />In addition, the festival has simply grown again.  Whether it&#39;s too big or still not big enough, I don&#39;t know.  My interpretation of what was happening was that there were an awful lot of people there who had been sent by their employer because everyone knows it&#39;s a cool place to be.  They didn&#39;t necessarily know how or why it was cool, but they were there to rub shoulders with the cool kids.  They were not contributing particularly to any coolness - they were there to observe and appreciate it.  And that, I think, is why SXSWi has moved on from being a must-do event to a &quot;might-do if I can get someone to pay for me to go&quot;  ]]></content:encoded>
