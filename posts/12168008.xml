	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's one week today till we start our trip in Boston.</p>
<p>We're having a party this evening from 5.30pm until we get tired and need to tidy up. &nbsp;Everyone's welcome, but please <a href="http://t2t-fundraiser.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">sign up here</a> to let us know you're coming. &nbsp;We're at the <a href="http://www.creativecollaboration.org.uk" target="_blank">Centre for Creative Collaboration</a>, 16 Acton St, London WC1X 9NG - y'know the place we've been doing Tuttle for a few weeks.</p>
<p>There'll be ukulele, poetry, folk guitar, something we don't really know about yet, and other things that will no doubt be entertaining but haven't yet been confirmed. &nbsp;Come and do your thing and if you have anything you'd like to donate as a raffle prize that'll get people buying tickets, do let us know and bring it along.</p>
<p>No matter what, in potluck style, please bring something to nibble on, something to swig and someone with deep pockets and a weakness for giving money to starving social artists.</p>]]></content:encoded>
