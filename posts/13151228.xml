<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Metrotwin</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I facilitated a group discussion on Thursday evening in New York about <a href="http://metrotwin.com">Metrotwin</a>, British Airways online social network for people who love New York and London. For the utmost fullness of disclosure I was involved in the original conceptual development of metrotwin with Many by Many and metrotwin paid for my flights to and from the States for this trip.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We had people who contribute to the site as bloggers as well as other wise digital folk. The substance of the conversation was subject to an NDA for the participants &ndash; they came up with some really interesting insights and ideas for future development &ndash; but I think it was also interesting as an example of how sites that use the power of social interactions online really need to engage in face to face social interactions too. The things I was reminded of, beyond the conversations we had about the state of the art in social networking were:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Some people like to show off what they know and who they are &ndash; often these are the same people who write a particular kind of blog &ndash; one with a strong identity and lots of links.</li>
<li>Others like to sit and listen and come up with an interesting analysis or synthesis of what is being said.</li>
<li>People who like being on social networking sites do (generally) like other people and want to help and be useful. An obvious outcome of this meeting is to continue to get metrotwin bloggers and users together to swap stories and build the relationships.</li>
<li>The smallest or shortest contributions can be just as valuable as the long and rambling ones. Some people just need fewer words to express what they have to say.</li>
<li>Whichever people come are the right people &ndash; this is one of Harrison Owen's principles for Open Space but it's important to remember in more formal situations too &ndash; I worried at first that a couple of people I'd invited couldn't make it, even though I knew they'd make a great contribution to the conversation On this occasion, it wasn't to be, but who am I to say for sure that the conversation was poorer?</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>New Work City</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">On Friday afternoon, Brian, Dana and I dropped into Tony Bacigalupo's <a href="http://nwcny.com">New Work City</a> coworking space. This was my first experience of a US coworking environment. Guess what? I felt right at home :) I haven't been in any US office spaces before apart from BBH the night before, and that's well y'know, an advertising agency... lovely but not that different from the London office (apart from the stunning view of the rest of Manhattan from the 19<sup>th</sup> floor) New Work City has a suite within an office building and my first reaction was it looked like something from the FBI &ndash; characterless corridors with tightly shut doors &ndash; everything looks the same and very little signage. However we finally found the suite for NWC, said hello to Tony and his coworkers and settled in. It actually felt to me quite like being in a small University computer lab (at least like the ones I hung out in as a student) where everyone knows each other.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We didn't have long and our main needs were mains power and wifi which we gratefully received but it was really nice to have somewhere else to be for a bit and I managed to knock my mailbox down to about 5 or 6 items &ndash; somehow I felt much more productive and ready to get stuff done there than I had done, sitting alone in my hotel room.</p>]]></content:encoded>
