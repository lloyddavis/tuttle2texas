	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm going to write here for a bit while I decide whether to set up a whole new space for the forthcoming 2011 trip.&nbsp; There's something nice about leaving tuttle2texas as a completed artefact, but also something attractive about keeping the continuity.&nbsp; It's all tied up too in whether talking about Texas is too confusing - it's really about a coast-to-coast trip that includes a big chunk of time in Texas. Open to ideas on this one, as ever.</p>
<p>So</p>
<p>I am going again.&nbsp; My plan is still to start somewhere on the West Coast at the beginning of March, take my time to get over to Austin for the opening of Interactive &amp; Film on 11th.&nbsp; I'd like to get a Gold Pass this year and see more of the Film festival as well as hanging out with my webby pals.</p>
<p>And then onto all the places we visited last year to see how those new friends are getting on and give them a taste of what the rest of the adventure was like.</p>
<p>I want to do the bulk of the journey by train again.&nbsp; It's an excellent creative constraint to be held to the timetable.&nbsp; I'm going to try to let go of any other rules completely.</p>
<p>So for starters, I don't know where to start on the West Coast.&nbsp; There's something nice about beginning in Long Beach with the #tuttlela crowd but I'm also aching to see San Francisco, Portland and Seattle *and* ideally too, I'd love to stop off in Alpine TX just before SXSW to see my mate <a href="http://gapingvoid.com">Hugh</a> in his native surroundings. I may be being greedy here, it has been known.</p>
<p>So <strong>your first task</strong> is help me decide - tell me where to start and why. And then how, in an ideal world, I'd make my way to Austin.</p>
<p>Secondly, I'm going to focus on *my* journey rather than try to get a bunch of people to come along with me and do it all together.&nbsp; It's just too complex.&nbsp; I am going.&nbsp; If you want to come with me for any leg of the trip or meet up in any of the cities I visit, then you are very welcome to do so, but it's up to you to work out the details.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I want to create some collaborative, lasting, social artefact for people to contribute to whether they're able to join in, in the States, or not.&nbsp; It's as poorly thought through as that so far.&nbsp; Ideas welcome.&nbsp; If you're somewhere on or near the route and you have fun things to do there that I could join in with also let me know, a theme might emerge...</p>
<p>I'm starting to refine the pitch for sponsors.&nbsp; If you have a client who you think would be interested in being associated with this thing, let me know.</p>]]></content:encoded>
