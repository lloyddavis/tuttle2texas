# tuttle2texas
Turning all the bits into a something collaborative(ly)

This is a repository of materials associated with the 2009-2010 project called tuttle2texas which involved a group of people from London and their various attempts at making a trip across the USA from Boston, MA to the 2010 SXSWi in Austin, TX via a whole bunch of people and places.

The idea is to use this repository as a basis for other works and to experiment with using github as a platform for creative collaboration in other forms than traditional code.
